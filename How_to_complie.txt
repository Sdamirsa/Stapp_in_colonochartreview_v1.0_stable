1- Install node.js 
2- Run "npm install" in the project folder 
3- Run "npm run dump "
4- Run "npm run serve"
! Note: There should be an app.py in the main folder 

If you did anything incorrectly, after changing revising the code, you should 1- remove the packages-lock.json and build/ and node_modlules 2-  do 2,3 again
"rm -rf node_modules\ package-lock.json"

5- Create the package.json build key for the final of the project (windows, linux, etc). Look at https://www.electron.build/
6- run npm dist
6- DONE :)

My debugs: 
[we should let user upload]
[changing some logic on st.session stat]
[json is not a good thing to save the data]
[how to download data]

My notes:
The whole app is ran in a sandbox, which means you can't autoamitcly read or write files. You should use st.upload_file and st.download_file instead.
